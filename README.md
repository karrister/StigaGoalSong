StigaGoalSong
=============

A project to make a simple Android application to be able to play and enjoy the Stiga table hockey game more than before!


What the applications does is that it allows you to track the time of game length, and to time down when game is over, to be able to follow an accurate game length. It also allows one to assign a goal song for one's team, triggered by the referee controlling the application.

Future tasks:
-Finish Bluetooth-remote project, and integrate into this application
-Make it possible to configure a "start offset" for each goal song separately, meaning no need to edit music files in order to get the goal song to start from a specific point of the song
-Implement tournaments and team lists (maybe even team stats over lifetime! and sync to a server to view on the web)
